    "abstract": "Wear resistant coatings were produced on a permanent mould cast MRI 230D Mg alloy by (a) PEO in silicate based electrolyte, (b) PEO in phosphate based electrolyte, (c) hybrid coatings of silicate PEO followed by laser surface alloying (LSA) with Al and Al2O3, and (d) hybrid coatings of phosphate PEO followed by LSA with Al and Al2O3. Microstructural characterization of the coatings was carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X(ray diffraction. The tribological behavior of the coatings was investigated under dry sliding condition using linearly reciprocating ball-on-flat wear test. Both the PEO coatings exhibited a friction coefficient of about 0.8 and hybrid coatings exhibited a value of about 0.5 against the AISI 52100 steel ball as the friction partner, which were slightly reduced with the increase in applied load. The PEO coatings sustained the test without failure at 2 N load but failed at 5 N load due to micro-fracture caused by high contact stresses. The hybrid coatings did not get completely worn off at 2 N load but were completely removed exposing the substrate at 5 N load. The PEO coatings exhibited better wear resistance than the hybrid coatings and silicate PEO coatings exhibited better wear resistance than the phosphate PEO coatings. Both the PEO coatings melted/decomposed on laser irradiation and all the hybrid coatings exhibited similar microstructure and wear behavior irrespective of the nature of the primary PEO coating or laser energies. SEM examination of worn surfaces indicated abrasive wear combined with adhesive wear for all the specimens. The surface of the ball exhibited a discontinuous transfer layer after the wear test.",

    "abstract": "Friction and wear are important phenomena occurring in all devices with moving parts. While their origin and the way they evolve over time are not fully understood, they are both intimately linked to surface roughness. Guided by pin-on-disc experiments, we present the steps giving rise to the formation of surface roughness on silica, first by the creation of roughly spherical wear particles whose size is related to a critical length scale governing the transition between ductile and brittle behavior, then by the accumulation of these small particles into a larger third body layer, or gouge. We show that, for the explored range of loading conditions, the surface roughness evolves toward a common steady state under unlubricated wear regardless of the initial surface roughness, hinting toward the possible predictability of roughness evolution in wearing components. The friction coefficient is shown to be related to the surface roughness and its time evolution is discussed as well.",

    "abstract": "Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a common way of diagnosing dental related diseases. Accurate segmentation of 3D tooth is of importance for the treatment. Although deep learning based methods have achieved convincing results in medical image processing, they need a large of annotated data for network training, making it very time-consuming in data collection and annotation. Besides, domain shift widely existing in the distribution of data acquired by different devices impacts severely the model generalization. To resolve the problem, we propose a multi-stage framework for 3D tooth segmentation in dental CBCT, which achieves the third place in the \"Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation\" 3D (STS-3D) challenge. The experiments on validation set compared with other semi-supervised segmentation methods further indicate the validity of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Consumer-grade biosensors offer a cost-effective alternative to medical-grade electromyography (EMG) systems, reducing hardware costs from thousands of dollars to approximately $13. However, these low-cost sensors introduce significant signal instability and motion artifacts. Deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained edge devices like the ESP32 presents a challenge: balancing classification accuracy with strict latency (&lt;100ms) and memory (&lt;320KB) constraints. Using a single-subject dataset comprising 1,540 seconds of raw data (1.54M data points, segmented into ~1,300 one-second windows), I evaluate 18 model architectures, ranging from statistical heuristics to deep transfer learning (ResNet50) and custom hybrid networks (MaxCRNN). While my custom \"MaxCRNN\" (Inception + Bi-LSTM + Attention) achieved the highest safety (99% Precision) and robustness, I identify Random Forest (74% accuracy) as the Pareto-optimal solution for embedded control on legacy microcontrollers. I demonstrate that reliable, low-latency EMG control is feasible on commodity hardware, with Deep Learning offering a path to near-perfect reliability on modern Edge AI accelerators.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art robotic hand prosthetics generate finger and wrist movement through pattern recognition (PR) algorithms using features of forearm electromyogram (EMG) signals, but re- quires extensive training and is prone to poor predictions for conditions outside the training data (Peerdeman et al., 2011; Scheme et al., 2010). We propose a novel approach to develop a dynamic robotic limb by utilizing the recent history of EMG signals in a model that accounts for physiological features of hand movement which are ignored by PR algorithms. We do this by viewing EMG signals as functional covariates and develop a functional linear model that quantifies the effect of the EMG signals on finger/wrist velocity through a bivariate coefficient function that is allowed to vary with current finger/wrist position. The model is made par- simonious and interpretable through a two-step variable selection procedure, called Sequential Adaptive Functional Empirical group LASSO (SAFE-gLASSO). Numerical studies show excel- lent selection and prediction properties of SAFE-gLASSO compared to popular alternatives. For our motivating dataset, the method correctly identifies the few EMG signals that are known to be important for an able-bodied subject with negligible false positives and the model can be directly implemented in a robotic prosthetic.",
